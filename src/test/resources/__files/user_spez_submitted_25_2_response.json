I ruined Thanksgiving. I\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.\n\nHi All,\n\nI am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.\n\nThe United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.\n\nMany of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&amp;sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).\n\nI spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.\n\nWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\n\nMore than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.\n\nHowever, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.\n\nHistorically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:\n\n* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\nPosts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.\n\n* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line\u2014up to an outright ban.\n\nAgain, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.\n\nSteve\n\nPS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users.

features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:\n\nHopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x\u2026) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.\n\nSpeaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.\n\nPrepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs). The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics\u2019. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.\n\nWe have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.\n\nWe did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, \"Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied.\" After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.\n\nLastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to [create an account](https://www.redditgifts.com/profiles/signup/). It will be a fantastic event this year.\n\nI will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.\n\nSteve\n\nu: I'm out for now. Will check back later.

Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, &amp;quot;Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied.&amp;quot; After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to &lt;a href=\"https://www.redditgifts.com/profiles/signup/\"&gt;create an account&lt;/a&gt;. It will be a fantastic event this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;u: I&amp;#39;m out for now. Will check back later.

Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we\u2019re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.\n\nWe\u2019ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we\u2019d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We\u2019re still in the early days, but I\u2019m happy we\u2019re dedicating resources to it.\n\nAs it relates to monetization, we\u2019ve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we\u2019ll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don\u2019t want to compromise what\u2019s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.\n\nYesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We\u2019ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust &amp; Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we\u2019ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We\u2019ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.\n\nHappy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.\n\ne: grammar\n\nu: Thank you!

These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don\u2019t want to compromise what\u2019s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in &lt;a href=\"/r/changelog\"&gt;r/changelog&lt;/a&gt; so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, we previewed &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/\"&gt;new moderator mail&lt;/a&gt; to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We\u2019ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust &amp;amp; Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we\u2019ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We\u2019ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;e: grammar&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;u: Thank you! Heading out for now. Will check back later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "qa", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false,

The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.\n\nThe changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/all\u2014our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple\u2014as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.\n\nMany people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the years\u2014ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. \n\nInterestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That\u2019s Reddit for you. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nAs always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit\u2014let\u2019s remember that.

The &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt;\u2014our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple\u2014as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people will ask if this is related to &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt;. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt; over the years\u2014ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt; was already getting downvoted out of &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, &lt;a href=\"/r/EnoughTrumpSpam\"&gt;r/EnoughTrumpSpam&lt;/a&gt; was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That\u2019s Reddit for you. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit\u2014let\u2019s remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let\u2019s all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;u: I&amp;#39;m off for now.

We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we\u2019ve published our [2015 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015). \n\nWe hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.\n\nOur goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn\u2019t easy as a small company as we don\u2019t always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.\n\nIn 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.\n\nIn 2016, we\u2019ve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users. We joined our industry peers in an amicus brief [supporting Twitter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/3d/Twitter_versus_Lynch_Amicus_Brief_February_2016.pdf), detailing our desire to be honest about the national security requests for removal of content and the disclosure of user account information.\n\nIn addition, we joined an amicus brief [supporting Apple](http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/Airbnb_Atlassian_Automattic_CloudFlare_eBay_GitHub_Kickstarter_LinkedIn_Mapbox_Medium_Meetup_Reddit_Square_Squarespace_Twilio_Twitter_and_Wickr.pdf) in their fight against the government's attempt to force a private company to work on behalf of them. While the government asked the court to [vacate the court order](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/28/technology/document-us-filing-dropping-apple-case.html) compelling Apple to assist them, we felt it was important to stand with Apple and speak out against this unprecedented move by the government, which threatens the relationship of trust between a platforms and its users, in addition to jeopardizing your privacy. \n\nWe are also excited to announce the launch of our [external law enforcement guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines).

We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we\u2019ve published our &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015\"&gt;2015 transparency report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy\"&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn\u2019t easy as a small company as we don\u2019t always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2016, we\u2019ve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users. We joined our industry peers in an amicus brief &lt;a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/3d/Twitter_versus_Lynch_Amicus_Brief_February_2016.pdf\"&gt;supporting Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, detailing our desire to be honest about the national security requests for removal of content and the disclosure of user account information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, we joined an amicus brief &lt;a href=\"http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/Airbnb_Atlassian_Automattic_CloudFlare_eBay_GitHub_Kickstarter_LinkedIn_Mapbox_Medium_Meetup_Reddit_Square_Squarespace_Twilio_Twitter_and_Wickr.pdf\"&gt;supporting Apple&lt;/a&gt; in their fight against the government&amp;#39;s attempt to force a private company to work on behalf of them. While the government asked the court to &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/28/technology/document-us-filing-dropping-apple-case.html\"&gt;vacate the court order&lt;/a&gt; compelling Apple to assist them, we felt it was important to stand with Apple and speak out against this unprecedented move by the government, which threatens the relationship of trust between a platforms and its users, in addition to jeopardizing your privacy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are also excited to announce the launch of our &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines\"&gt;external law enforcement guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.

Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.\n\nThe new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but it\u2019s shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).\n\nOne notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.\n\nIn addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/). Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.\n\nIndividually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie), and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related [extensions](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034).\n\nWe are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist.

This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.\n\nOne thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we\u2019re careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.\n\nAs Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.\n\nTherefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit\u2014or at least say on our public pages\u2014in the spirit of our mission.\n\nThese types of content are prohibited [1]:\n\n * Spam\n * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)\n * Publication of someone\u2019s private and confidential information\n * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say \"I don't like this group of people.\" It's not ok to say, \"I'm going to kill this group of people.\")\n * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]\n * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors\n\nThere are other types of content that are specifically classified:\n\n * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.\n * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.\n\nWe've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don\u2019t pollute people\u2019s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor\u2019s listings, and we think it\u2019ll work for this other type of content as well. \n\nNo company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We\u2019ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don\u2019t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it\u2019s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.\n\n[1] This is basically what we have right now. I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.\n\n[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this \"Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.\"\n\nedit: added an example to clarify our concept of \"harm\"\nedit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy\n\nupdate: I'm out of here, everyone.

Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Publication of someone\u2019s private and confidential information&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it&amp;#39;s ok to say &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like this group of people.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s not ok to say, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to kill this group of people.&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Anything that &lt;a href=\"http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html\"&gt;harasses, bullies, or abuses&lt;/a&gt; an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sexually suggestive content featuring minors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are other types of content that are specifically classified:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it&amp;#39;s worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don\u2019t pollute people\u2019s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor\u2019s listings, and we think it\u2019ll work for this other type of content as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We\u2019ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don\u2019t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it\u2019s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[1] This is basically what we have right now. I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[2] Wording we&amp;#39;ve used elsewhere is this &amp;quot;Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: added an example to clarify our concept of &amp;quot;harm&amp;quot;\nedit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;update: I&amp;#39;m out of here, everyone. Thank you so much for the feedback. I found this very productive. I&amp;#39;ll check back later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "qa", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false,
